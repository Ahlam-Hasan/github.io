# Ahlam's  project
Welcome To My Project!

## About Me
Hello, my name is Ahlam Hasan, I am currently studying a Full Stack Web Development course at the HackerU College,
and I am also a Bachelor's degree student in Computer Science at the Open University.
In addition to my field of study :), I especially enjoy learning new things, volunteering, playing the piano,
and immersing myself in music that inspires and energizes me.

Two years ago, I was forced to stop my studies for certain reasons.
But with my determination and perseverance, I returned to my studies, and I am proud that I am not giving up on my dream
of being part of the world of high-tech and technology.
So far, I have gained a wealth of knowledge in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Sass, and Responsive Design.

I am excited about the challenges ahead and believe that I have something to contribute and offer in every project I work on.
I would be happy to present my project later and show how I combine my skills and knowledge for the benefit
of high-quality and professional products.
